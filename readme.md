# GitHub client for Windows Phone 8

This little project is a read-only GitHub client for Windows Phone 8.
It's still under development, but when I found the time to finish it,
you can get it from the app store as well.

## What can this do?
* Viewing your repositories
* Browsing and viewing source code files
* Viewing diffs in your commits
* Checking your commit history

## Why not use OctoKit.NET?

This project was meant to be fun, and trying to set up a library to
support WP8 is not fun. So I decided that I might as well write the few 
API calls needed for this app.
